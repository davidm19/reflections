How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?\
It allowed me to see all the differences between the two files, which made it easy to pinpoint the mistake.\
\

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?\
It makes me able to draw inspiration for new work from old pieces of work and improve upon what I have now.\
\

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?\
Pros: 
Indicative of logical changes;
Cons: 
Risk of losing file or changes in the file when something crashes; Less convenient

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?\
Because it knows that sometimes people like to work on projects which involve multiple files, so they\'92re making it more convenient for the user.\
\

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?\
Git log lists the commits of files in the repository, and git diff shows the differences.\
\

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?\
Because now you know how to identify and solve problems in your code.\
\

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?\
To learn how to code so I can succeed in not just my AP Comp Sci class, but in the world of Computer Science in general, for it is something I want to major in in college.}
